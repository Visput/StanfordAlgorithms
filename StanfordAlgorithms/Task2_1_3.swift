// Question 1:
// In this programming problem you'll code up Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm.
// This file describes an undirected graph with integer edge costs. It has the format
// [number_of_nodes] [number_of_edges]
// [one_node_of_edge_1] [other_node_of_edge_1] [edge_1_cost]
// [one_node_of_edge_2] [other_node_of_edge_2] [edge_2_cost]
// ...
// For example, the third line of the file is "2 3 -8874", indicating that there is an edge connecting vertex #2 and vertex #3 that has cost -8874.
// You should NOT assume that edge costs are positive, nor should you assume that they are distinct.
// Your task is to run Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm on this graph. 
// You should report the overall cost of a minimum spanning tree --- an integer, which may or may not be negative --- in the box below.
