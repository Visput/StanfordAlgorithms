// Question 1:
// In this programming problem and the next you'll code up the greedy algorithms from lecture for minimizing the weighted sum of completion times..
// The file describes a set of jobs with positive and integral weights and lengths. It has the format
// [number_of_jobs]
// [job_1_weight] [job_1_length]
// [job_2_weight] [job_2_length]
// ...
// For example, the third line of the file is "74 59", indicating that the second job has weight 74 and length 59.
// You should NOT assume that edge weights or lengths are distinct.
// Your task in this problem is to run the greedy algorithm that schedules jobs in decreasing order of the difference (weight - length). 
// Recall from lecture that this algorithm is not always optimal. IMPORTANT: if two jobs have equal difference (weight - length), 
// you should schedule the job with higher weight first. Beware: if you break ties in a different way, you are likely to get the wrong answer. 
// You should report the sum of weighted completion times of the resulting schedule --- a positive integer --- in the box below.

// Question 2:
// For this problem, use the same data set as in the previous problem.
// Your task now is to run the greedy algorithm that schedules jobs (optimally) in decreasing order of the ratio (weight/length). 
// In this algorithm, it does not matter how you break ties. You should report the sum of weighted completion times 
// of the resulting schedule --- a positive integer --- in the box below.
