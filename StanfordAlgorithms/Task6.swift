// Question 1.
// The goal of this problem is to implement a variant of the 2-SUM algorithm (covered in the Week 6 lecture on hash table applications).
// The file contains 1 million integers, both positive and negative (there might be some repetitions!).
// This is your array of integers, with the ith row of the file specifying the ith entry of the array.
// Your task is to compute the number of target values t in the interval [-10000,10000] (inclusive) 
// such that there are distinct numbers x,y in the input file that satisfy x+y=t. 
// (NOTE: ensuring distinctness requires a one-line addition to the algorithm from lecture.)
// Write your numeric answer (an integer between 0 and 20001) in the space provided.
