// Question 1.
// The file contains the edges of a directed graph. Vertices are labeled as positive integers from 1 to 875714. 
// Every row indicates an edge, the vertex label in first column is the tail and the vertex label in second column 
// is the head (recall the graph is directed, and the edges are directed from the first column vertex to the second column vertex). 
// So for example, the 11th row looks liks : "2 47646". This just means that the vertex with label 2 has 
// an outgoing edge to the vertex with label 47646
// Your task is to code up the algorithm from the video lectures for computing strongly connected components (SCCs), 
// and to run this algorithm on the given graph.
// Output Format: You should output the sizes of the 5 largest SCCs in the given graph, in decreasing order of sizes, separated by commas 
// (avoid any spaces). So if your algorithm computes the sizes of the five largest SCCs to be 500, 400, 300, 200 and 100, 
// then your answer should be "500,400,300,200,100" (without the quotes). If your algorithm finds less than 5 SCCs, 
// then write 0 for the remaining terms. Thus, if your algorithm computes only 3 SCCs whose sizes are 400, 300, and 100, 
// then your answer should be "400,300,100,0,0" (without the quotes). (Note also that your answer should not have any spaces in it.)
